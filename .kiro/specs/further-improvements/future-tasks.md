# Future Tasks - Performance and Caching Improvements

## Flow Processing Cache Implementation

### Task: In-Memory Flow Cache for Performance Optimization

**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Dependencies**: Bidirectional flow aggregation implementation

#### Description
Implement an in-memory cache for flow lookup operations to reduce database queries during high-volume packet processing. This will significantly improve performance when processing large PCAP files with many flows.

#### Technical Requirements

1. **Cache Interface Design**:
   ```go
   type FlowCache interface {
       Get(canonicalSrc, canonicalDst, protocol string) (*model.Flow, bool)
       Put(flow *model.Flow) error
       Remove(canonicalSrc, canonicalDst, protocol string) error
       Clear() error
       Stats() CacheStats
   }
   ```

2. **Cache Implementation Features**:
   - LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy
   - Configurable maximum cache size (default: 10,000 flows)
   - Configurable TTL (Time To Live) for cache entries (default: 30 minutes)
   - Thread-safe operations for concurrent access
   - Cache hit/miss metrics collection

3. **Configuration Options**:
   ```go
   type FlowCacheConfig struct {
       MaxSize         int           // Maximum number of cached flows
       TTL             time.Duration // Time to live for cache entries
       EvictionPolicy  string        // "lru", "fifo", "ttl"
       MetricsEnabled  bool          // Enable cache metrics collection
   }
   ```

4. **Integration Points**:
   - Modify `UpsertFlow` method to check cache before database lookup
   - Update cache when flows are modified or created
   - Add cache warming during application startup for frequent flows
   - Implement cache invalidation strategy for memory pressure

#### Performance Targets
- Reduce database queries by 70-80% for flow lookups
- Cache hit ratio target: >85% for typical PCAP processing workloads
- Memory usage: <100MB for 10,000 cached flows
- Cache operation latency: <1ms for get/put operations

#### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Basic LRU Cache** (1 day)
- Implement basic LRU cache with configurable size
- Add thread-safe operations using sync.RWMutex
- Basic cache statistics collection

**Phase 2: TTL and Advanced Features** (1 day)
- Add TTL-based expiration for cache entries
- Implement background cleanup goroutine
- Add cache warming functionality

**Phase 3: Integration and Optimization** (1 day)
- Integrate cache with repository layer
- Add configuration management
- Performance testing and optimization
- Memory profiling and optimization

#### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for cache operations (get, put, eviction)
- Concurrent access testing with multiple goroutines
- Performance benchmarks comparing cached vs non-cached operations
- Memory leak testing for long-running operations
- Cache invalidation testing under various scenarios

#### Configuration Example
```go
// Default cache configuration
config := FlowCacheConfig{
    MaxSize:        10000,
    TTL:           30 * time.Minute,
    EvictionPolicy: "lru",
    MetricsEnabled: true,
}

// High-performance configuration for large PCAP files
highPerfConfig := FlowCacheConfig{
    MaxSize:        50000,
    TTL:           60 * time.Minute,
    EvictionPolicy: "lru",
    MetricsEnabled: true,
}
```

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Cache implementation passes all unit tests
- [ ] Performance improvement of >50% for flow lookup operations
- [ ] Memory usage stays within configured limits
- [ ] Cache hit ratio >80% in realistic test scenarios
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended operation
- [ ] Thread-safe operation under concurrent load

## Additional Future Improvements

### Task: Batch Flow Processing

**Priority**: Low  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

Implement batch processing for flow updates to reduce database transaction overhead. Instead of updating flows individually, collect flow updates and process them in batches.

### Task: Flow Compression for Large Packet References

**Priority**: Low  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

Implement compression for packet reference arrays when flows contain thousands of packets. This will reduce memory usage and database storage requirements for long-running flows.

### Task: Advanced Service Port Detection

**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 2 days

Extend service port detection to include:
- Dynamic port detection based on protocol analysis
- Custom service port configuration
- Industrial protocol port detection (PROFINET, DNP3, IEC 61850)
- Port mapping persistence across sessions

### Task: Flow Analytics and Reporting

**Priority**: Low  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

Implement flow analytics features:
- Flow duration analysis
- Bandwidth utilization reporting
- Top talkers identification
- Communication pattern analysis
- Flow anomaly detection

## Implementation Notes

### Cache Performance Monitoring
```go
type CacheStats struct {
    Hits           int64
    Misses         int64
    Evictions      int64
    Size           int
    HitRatio       float64
    MemoryUsage    int64
    LastEviction   time.Time
}
```

### Cache Metrics Integration
The cache should integrate with existing logging infrastructure to provide visibility into cache performance and help with tuning cache parameters for different workloads.

### Memory Management
Implement proper memory management to prevent cache from consuming excessive memory during high-volume processing. Include configurable memory limits and automatic cache size adjustment based on available system memory.
