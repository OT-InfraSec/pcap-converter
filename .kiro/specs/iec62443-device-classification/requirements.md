# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements IEC 62443 device classification and industrial protocol detection capabilities for the Go PCAP Importer. Building on the existing device discovery foundation, this enhancement will identify industrial devices and classify them based on protocol usage patterns, specifically focusing on EtherNet/IP and OPC UA protocols. This is the first phase toward full IEC 62443 compliance auditing and network security zone identification.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: EtherNet/IP Protocol Detection

**User Story:** As a network security auditor, I want the system to detect and parse EtherNet/IP protocol communications, so that I can identify industrial devices using this protocol.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a packet contains EtherNet/IP traffic on TCP port 44818 THEN the system SHALL identify it as EtherNet/IP protocol
2. WHEN a packet contains EtherNet/IP traffic on UDP port 2222 THEN the system SHALL identify it as EtherNet/IP protocol  
3. WHEN EtherNet/IP packets are detected THEN the system SHALL extract device identity information from the protocol headers
4. WHEN EtherNet/IP Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) data is present THEN the system SHALL parse and store relevant device attributes
5. WHEN EtherNet/IP implicit messaging is detected THEN the system SHALL identify the communication as real-time I/O data

### Requirement 2: OPC UA Protocol Detection

**User Story:** As a network security auditor, I want the system to detect and parse OPC UA protocol communications, so that I can identify industrial devices and their security configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a packet contains OPC UA traffic on TCP port 4840 THEN the system SHALL identify it as OPC UA protocol
2. WHEN OPC UA handshake messages are detected THEN the system SHALL extract client and server identity information
3. WHEN OPC UA security policy information is present THEN the system SHALL store the security configuration details
4. WHEN OPC UA service calls are detected THEN the system SHALL identify the type of industrial operations being performed
5. WHEN OPC UA subscription data is present THEN the system SHALL identify real-time data exchange patterns

### Requirement 3: Industrial Device Classification

**User Story:** As a network security auditor, I want devices to be automatically classified by their industrial role and type, so that I can understand the network's industrial architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a device communicates using EtherNet/IP explicit messaging THEN the system SHALL classify it as a potential PLC or industrial controller
2. WHEN a device initiates OPC UA client connections THEN the system SHALL classify it as a potential HMI or engineering workstation
3. WHEN a device accepts OPC UA server connections THEN the system SHALL classify it as a potential PLC, historian, or industrial server
4. WHEN a device uses EtherNet/IP implicit messaging patterns THEN the system SHALL classify it as an I/O device or sensor/actuator
5. WHEN a device shows mixed protocol usage patterns THEN the system SHALL assign multiple classification tags
6. WHEN device classification is determined THEN the system SHALL store the classification with confidence levels

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Device Data Model

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an enhanced device data model that can store industrial device attributes, so that the system can support IEC 62443 analysis requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an industrial device is detected THEN the system SHALL store its device type classification
2. WHEN protocol-specific attributes are extracted THEN the system SHALL store them in structured format
3. WHEN security-relevant information is detected THEN the system SHALL flag it for compliance analysis
4. WHEN device roles are inferred THEN the system SHALL store role classifications with timestamps
5. WHEN multiple protocols are detected from the same device THEN the system SHALL maintain protocol usage statistics

### Requirement 5: Protocol Usage Pattern Analysis

**User Story:** As a network security auditor, I want to analyze communication patterns between industrial devices, so that I can understand the operational relationships and data flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN EtherNet/IP connections are established THEN the system SHALL track producer-consumer relationships
2. WHEN OPC UA subscriptions are created THEN the system SHALL map client-server data relationships  
3. WHEN periodic communication patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL identify and classify the communication frequency
4. WHEN request-response patterns are analyzed THEN the system SHALL determine communication criticality levels
5. WHEN communication patterns change over time THEN the system SHALL update device classifications accordingly

### Requirement 6: Integration with Existing Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new industrial protocol support to integrate seamlessly with the existing parser and repository architecture, so that the system remains maintainable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new protocol parsers are added THEN they SHALL implement the existing PacketParser interface pattern
2. WHEN industrial device data is stored THEN it SHALL use the existing Repository interface
3. WHEN new data models are created THEN they SHALL include validation methods following existing patterns
4. WHEN protocol detection is performed THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing gopacket parsing pipeline
5. WHEN tests are written THEN they SHALL follow the existing London School TDD patterns with mocks
