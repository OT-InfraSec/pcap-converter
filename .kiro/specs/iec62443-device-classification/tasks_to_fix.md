# Tasks To Fix & Complete (IEC 62443 Device Classification & Industrial Parser Integration)

## Summary
This plan lists all remaining and incomplete tasks for IEC 62443 device classification and industrial protocol parser integration, based on the current state of implementation and requirements/design documents. Each task is broken down into subtasks with explanations and file locations for implementation.

---

## 1. Protocol Layer Validation & Safe Extraction (Critical)
- **Add comprehensive validation and robust extraction for all protocol-specific data**
  - File: `lib/layers/ethernetip.go`, `lib/layers/opcua.go`, `internal/parser/industrial_parser.go`
  - Subtasks:
    - Implement thorough validation methods for EtherNet/IP and OPC UA layers (field-level checks, value ranges, structure integrity).
    - Replace placeholder validation and extraction methods in `industrial_parser.go` with robust logic that checks all relevant fields and handles edge cases.
    - Ensure all extracted fields are checked for correctness and completeness, including device identity, CIP info, security info, and service info.
    - Use error handler for all invalid/malformed data and log recoverable/non-recoverable errors.
    - Add/extend unit tests for malformed/invalid data scenarios in `industrial_parser_test.go` and `ethernetip_test.go`/`opcua_test.go`.
  - **Approach:**
    - Defensive programming: never trust packet data without validation.
    - Use table-driven tests for all validation and extraction logic.
    - Log and recover from all protocol parsing errors using the error handler.
    - Document validation logic and edge cases in code comments and architecture docs.

---

## 2. Repository & CLI Integration (Enhancements)
- **Extend repository and CLI for industrial protocol info and device classification**
  - File: `internal/repository/repository.go`, `cmd/main.go`
  - Subtasks:
    - Review and extend repository methods for saving/querying industrial protocol info and device classification (ensure all new fields and types are supported).
    - Add/verify CLI flags for enabling/disabling industrial protocol parsing and selecting protocols (ensure user can control analysis scope).
    - Ensure CLI output includes industrial device analysis, protocol usage stats, and classification confidence.
    - Add/extend tests for repository and CLI integration in `sqlite_repository_industrial_test.go` and `industrial_cli_test.go`.
  - **Approach:**
    - Maintain backward compatibility with existing repository and CLI.
    - Use parameterized queries and safe data handling for all new fields.
    - Document CLI usage and repository changes in README and architecture docs.

---

## 3. Configuration Management & Performance Optimization
- **Implement configuration struct and optimize parser performance**
  - File: `internal/parser/industrial_parser.go`, `cmd/main.go`
  - Subtasks:
    - Add `IndustrialParserConfig` struct for protocol selection, confidence/error thresholds, and validation level.
    - Refactor parser to use config struct for all options and thresholds.
    - Optimize parser for lazy loading, port-based pre-filtering, and memory usage (profile and tune for large PCAP files and mixed traffic).
    - Add/extend performance benchmarks and stress tests in `industrial_parser_test.go`.
  - **Approach:**
    - Make industrial parsing optional and configurable via CLI and config struct.
    - Profile and optimize for speed and memory usage.
    - Document configuration options and performance strategies in code and docs.

---

## 4. Documentation & Risk Mitigation
- **Document all new interfaces, error handling, and configuration options**
  - File: `architecture.md`, `parser-integration.md`, code comments
  - Subtasks:
    - Update architecture and integration docs with new components, validation logic, and error handling strategies.
    - Document risk mitigation for performance, error propagation, memory usage, and backward compatibility.
    - Add usage examples and configuration instructions for CLI and parser options.
  - **Approach:**
    - Ensure all new code is well-documented and maintainable.
    - Add code comments for all validation and error handling logic.
    - Provide clear instructions for users and maintainers.

---

## 5. Success Criteria & Final Validation
- **Verify all requirements and design goals are met**
  - Subtasks:
    - Confirm all functional, technical, and testing requirements from requirements.md and parser-integration.md are satisfied.
    - Run full test suite and performance benchmarks (unit, integration, stress tests).
    - Validate backward compatibility and error handling in all scenarios.
    - Address any remaining gaps before release.
  - **Approach:**
    - Use checklist from parser-integration.md success criteria.
    - Document validation and test results in release notes.

---

## Next Steps
- Prioritize critical tasks (protocol validation, repository/CLI integration, configuration management).
- Begin implementation and track progress against subtasks.
- Review and align this plan with stakeholders before release.

**This updated plan focuses only on the remaining and incomplete work, with detailed subtasks and explanations for each area. All completed tasks have been removed.**
