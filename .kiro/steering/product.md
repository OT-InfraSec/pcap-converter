# Product Overview

Go PCAP Importer is a high-performance, testable, and extensible tool for importing PCAP (packet capture) files into SQL databases and performing IEC 62443 industrial network security analysis.

## Primary Goal
**Identify network security zones of industrial networks according to IEC 62443-2 and IEC 62443-3 standards through PCAP file analysis alone.**

The ultimate objective is to enable comprehensive IEC 62443 compliance audits using only network packet capture data, without requiring direct access to industrial control systems.

## Core Purpose
- Import network packet capture files into SQLite databases
- Remove secrets or sensitive data transmitted over network 
- Extract and analyze network devices, flows, and protocol information
- **Identify and classify network security zones per IEC 62443 standards**
- **Enable IEC 62443 compliance auditing via PCAP analysis**
- Support extensible protocol analysis for network security and monitoring

## Current Implementation Status
- âœ… **Device Discovery**: MAC/IP address extraction and device identification
- âœ… **Protocol Analysis**: Ethernet, IPv4/IPv6, TCP, UDP, DNS support
- âœ… **Flow Analysis**: Network communication patterns and relationships
- ðŸ”„ **Next Phase**: Network security zone identification and IEC 62443 compliance analysis

## Key Features
- CLI tool for PCAP file processing
- Packet, device, and flow extraction (MAC addresses, IP addresses, 5-tuple flows)
- DNS query analysis and correlation
- Extensible protocol support (with industrial protocol support planned)
- Performance-optimized batch processing
- **Industrial network security zone classification (planned)**
- **IEC 62443 compliance reporting (planned)**

## Target Use Cases
- **IEC 62443 compliance auditing for industrial networks**
- **Industrial network security zone identification and validation**
- Network security analysis and risk assessment
- Traffic monitoring and forensics
- Device discovery and network mapping
- Protocol analysis and troubleshooting

## IEC 62443 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Enhanced Device Classification
- **Priority Protocols**: EtherNet/IP and OPC UA detection and analysis
- Industrial device type identification via protocol usage and communication patterns
- Device role classification (PLCs, HMIs, SCADA systems, workstations)
- Asset inventory with security-relevant attributes

### Phase 2: Network Boundary Detection
- **Router-based boundaries**: Identify zone separations at Layer 3 routing points
- **Firewall boundaries**: Detect security enforcement points
- **VLAN boundaries**: Identify zone separations based on VLAN changes
- Communication path analysis between detected boundaries

### Phase 3: Security Requirements Inference
- Analyze device security requirements based on device type and role
- Map communication patterns to security criticality
- Infer security level requirements per device and communication path

### Phase 4: Security Zone Classification
- Zone classification per IEC 62443-3-2 Security Levels (SL 1-4)
- Combine network topology analysis with device type identification
- Validate zone boundaries against communication patterns
- Security level assessment based on inferred device requirements

### Phase 5: Compliance Reporting
- **PDF audit report generation** with findings and recommendations
- IEC 62443-2-1 security management compliance validation
- IEC 62443-3-3 system security requirements validation
- Zone-specific security recommendations
