# Daily Test Coverage Improver - Status Report

## Date: 2025-10-11

## Actions Completed

### 1. Research Phase (Step 1)
✅ **COMPLETED** - Created research discussion (attempted via safe-outputs tool)

**Key Findings:**
- Go project with 46 source files and 23 test files
- Uses gopacket, go-sqlite3, cobra, and testify
- 11 of 12 protocol layer files in `lib/layers/` lack tests
- Helper utilities (`lib/helper/address.go`, `lib/model/mac_address_set.go`) untested
- Largest untested files: lldp.go (1,636 lines), tls.go (739 lines), ciscoDiscovery.go (678 lines)

**Build Requirements:**
- Go 1.24.1
- libpcap-dev system package (for gopacket)
- Standard go test toolchain

### 2. Coverage Steps Configuration (Step 2)
✅ **FILE CREATED** - `.github/actions/daily-test-improver/coverage-steps/action.yml`
❌ **NOT PUSHED/PR'd** - Due to safe-outputs tool issues

**Configuration includes:**
1. Install libpcap-dev
2. Setup Go 1.24
3. Download modules
4. Build project
5. Run tests with coverage
6. Generate coverage summary
7. Generate HTML report  
8. Display overall coverage
9. Upload artifacts

**Local Branch:** `daily-test-improver/coverage-steps-config`
**Commit:** 8d5167c

## Issues Encountered

### Permission Problems
Multiple commands failed with "Permission denied" errors:
- `sudo apt-get` (needed for libpcap-dev)
- Various file operations with `tee`
- Test execution with `go test`

This prevented manual testing of the coverage steps (step 2f).

### Safe-Outputs Tool Issues  
The safe-outputs tools didn't appear to work correctly:
- `create_discussion`: Discussion not visible in repo
- `create_pull_request`: PR not created/branch not pushed
- `create_issue`: Permission denied

## What Needs to Happen Next

### Immediate Actions Needed:

1. **Push the branch manually:**
   ```bash
   git push origin daily-test-improver/coverage-steps-config
   ```

2. **Create PR manually for the coverage steps configuration**
   - Title: "Daily Test Coverage Improver - Updates to complete configuration"
   - Include the action.yml file
   - Request maintainer review

3. **Test the coverage steps in proper CI environment:**
   ```bash
   # In a GitHub Actions environment or system with libpcap-dev:
   sudo apt-get install -y libpcap-dev
   go build ./cmd/importer
   go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
   go tool cover -func=coverage.out
   ```

4. **Create the research discussion manually:**
   - Title: "Daily Test Coverage Improver - Research and Plan"
   - Include findings from research phase
   - See details below

### Alternative: Manual Configuration

If the automated approach doesn't work, maintainers can manually create:
`.github/actions/daily-test-improver/coverage-steps/action.yml`

With the content already created in this repository on the branch mentioned above.

## Research Discussion Content

(To be created manually if safe-outputs didn't work)

### Repository Summary
- Go-based PCAP importer for network traffic analysis
- Supports industrial protocols (EtherNet/IP, OPC UA, Modbus TCP)
- Uses London School TDD with interfaces and mocks
- 23 test files, 46 source files

### Coverage Gaps
Primary opportunities in `lib/layers/`:
- tls.go, lldp.go, mdns.go, http.go, ciscoDiscovery.go, igmp.go, eigrp.go, modbustcp.go, ssdp.go, stp.go, base.go

Secondary in helpers/models:
- lib/helper/address.go
- lib/model/mac_address_set.go

### Testing Strategy
1. Start with simple protocols (stp, base, ssdp)
2. Progress to medium complexity (modbustcp, mdns, igmp)
3. Tackle complex protocols (http, tls, lldp)
4. Add edge case and error handling tests
5. Use table-driven tests with fixtures

### Questions for Maintainers
1. Priority protocols for testing?
2. Sample PCAP files available?
3. Known bugs to cover with tests?
4. Target coverage percentage?
5. Should mocks be tested?

## Exit Reason

Per workflow instructions (step 2f-2g): 
> "If you can't get it to work, then create an issue describing the problem and exit the entire workflow."

Unable to complete manual testing due to permission constraints. Configuration created but requires maintainer verification.

## Recommendations

1. Test the action.yml configuration in actual GitHub Actions environment
2. Adjust steps if needed based on actual CI environment
3. Once working, proceed with step 3 (coverage analysis and test writing)
4. Consider using GitHub-hosted runners which have appropriate permissions
