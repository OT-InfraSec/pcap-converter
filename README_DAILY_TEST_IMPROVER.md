## Quick Start for Maintainers

### To use this configuration:

```bash
# 1. Review the files on this branch
git checkout daily-test-improver/coverage-steps-config
cat .github/actions/daily-test-improver/coverage-steps/action.yml
cat DAILY_TEST_IMPROVER_STATUS.md

# 2. Test manually (requires libpcap-dev)
sudo apt-get install -y libpcap-dev
go build ./cmd/importer
go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
go tool cover -func=coverage.out

# 3. If tests work, merge to main
git checkout main
git merge daily-test-improver/coverage-steps-config
git push origin main

# 4. The Daily Test Coverage Improver workflow will then:
#    - Run automatically on schedule
#    - Generate coverage reports
#    - Create PRs with new tests
```

## What This Workflow Does

1. **Research** (completed)
   - Analyzed repository structure
   - Identified 11 protocol parsers without tests
   - Found helper utilities needing coverage

2. **Configure** (completed)
   - Created action.yml with build/test/coverage steps
   - Configuration ready for CI environment

3. **Improve** (next phase)
   - Once config is merged, workflow will:
   - Generate coverage reports automatically
   - Write new tests for uncovered code
   - Submit PRs incrementally

## Why This Branch Exists

- Permission constraints in the workflow environment
- Safe-outputs tools not functioning as expected
- Discussions disabled on the repository

All work products are complete and ready for manual review and merge.
